QR-Based AR Indoor Navigation System
(Third Year Mini Project)
📌 Project Overview

The QR-Based AR Indoor Navigation System is an Augmented Reality application that helps users navigate indoor environments by displaying real-time AR directions over the camera view.

Users scan a QR code placed at their current location, select a destination, and follow AR-based arrows to reach the target.
The system works without GPS, making it suitable for indoor areas such as colleges, hospitals, malls, and offices.

⚙️ Working Principle

QR codes are placed at important indoor locations.

The user scans a QR code using the mobile app.

The system identifies the user’s current position.

SLAM tracks the user’s movement in real time.

The A* algorithm calculates the shortest path.

AR arrows and animations guide the user to the destination.
